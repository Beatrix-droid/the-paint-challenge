# goal: to find minimum cost of cans to paint wall


#ASSUMPTIONS

#choose one brand of paint cans
#choose paint from only one website
#choose only one colour (for now)
#wall is rectangular
#that paint cans come in distinct sizes 
#on average litre of paints covers on average 6.5 metres


# a dict containing the sizes of paint cans and how many litres of paint they can hold

#average price of paint is 18.08Â£ and it was obtained by computing the average of the following list that
# contians a range of various Uk paints priced per litre
